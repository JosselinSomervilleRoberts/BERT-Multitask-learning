1642	6cb7e15bfb8c6a52fb1bab1ad	 It rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide .	3
1643	dc17eca60a47c607a4b9de455	 This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of Zhao Benshan and the delicate ways of Dong Jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore . '	3

1645	22feba3bff56807f0bb11d541	 Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .	1
1646	1e176df83fba2039091c9173e	 The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .	1

1652	42e542e842c07613368d1c0cd	 In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .	3

1664	47653ae9988dfdfc75384537b	 Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes .	3

1668	e92280ad9c1fd6345bb92827e	 Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .	3

2187	1c82b1868ab1fb60d312b7af5	 The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .	1

2190	f2006a91f362e4e66cd7cf0fb	 All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .	1
2191	52b31489b3f90df3df7751b3f	 While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour TV documentary .	1
2192	74e75698b173bf73031639338	 While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie 's Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .	1
2193	8bcb06e77b391dfc1354030ba	 There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid	1

2196	078ab6d8883205310e43fc975	 This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .	1
2197	cd6fc7b21755641275c41fc48	 On its own , it 's not very interesting .	1
2198	414b4442631fb5e37a9f912c6	 The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...	1
2199	827ab78c35bd26c2604b2b9b4	 The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .	1

2201	aa2e5a798f017f633241e8ff1	 Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .	1
2202	95d21cba5ced4f730ba48af0d	 The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .	1
2203	58cfbf822f86f038ae971b833	 Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .	1
2204	8b7f57ceaacaf31fe026f9ca5	 With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .	1
2205	bfda85f3fe9ccd81a3343cb3a	 Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .	1
2206	48739d08794e7bb1ad6568b95	 Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .	1
2207	638d786ffbc48df2d931e8837	 Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .	1
2208	13f2a8d6c83a202a297caedcf	 PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .	1

2210	087c79982f376abcee0fb0659	 An odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .	1
2211	29af42704ee6cc3c5d3c9d9d4	 Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .	1
2212	d32a5766f8c42ed32a7713330	 Pascale Bailly 's rom-com provides Amélie 's Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .	1

2214	14b3c4ee080f7ac83a471fe1b	 ... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .	1
2215	28b3402e1905559789eb73516	 Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .	1
2216	e08d41a39bfeefcaa3e5390ba	 Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .	1

2222	f29d7b25e1dc3253c086f53ac	 Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .	1
2223	a352c9173609828f97c35afa8	 One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off	1
2224	0bb99691232e7f1e23fd7bb35	 Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .	1

2226	2bb1366b640bfd36c21b68d47	 The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .	1

2232	9e2fa3262b2fc581e5063d464	 There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .	1

2242	5e8093df2ce574f893a123acb	 The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .	1

2244	74e8b59cbeda2026843f0a776	 Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .	3
2245	df376e964603f56acdd52a0d8	 J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .	3
2246	b4e3cb1c292023a70c1812898	 Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .	1
2247	a10265c38652c35528ab83f18	 Wow .	3
2248	f69962b736b631d57895ba936	 Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .	1
2249	730b72e3a8ac0f6eddd1e1dc1	 The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .	1
2250	89532597cd57909e1c7904764	 None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .	1
2251	24a4a1dd087691f7884fd871c	 A processed comedy chop suey .	1
2252	b7cc87087753fcff10da7fa18	 Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .	1
2253	4adaa01e5b32a617f5bc967f8	 The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .	1

2256	29bf52c3686c61e6a25ec1355	 So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .	3
2257	b32776139edeaf8cfb780457c	 Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .	1
2258	a23f231b0740f3c751a2df3f4	 What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .	1
2259	6212aac885de4db8accb4edb0	 Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .	1
2260	63d37960f752547b24c470d80	 The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .	3

2286	511ee28292e367d4198402c87	 The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .	1
2287	d5ab19f99d7c29f686e8fc88f	 Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .	1

2772	81b0a295edfada89c8d8e4e16	 Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .	1

2777	84eb0cd4d4124e454f8775fdb	 There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .	1
2778	10247bfaeef21853307c9fab0	 Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .	1

2818	019974860946a5ad60bb6d3e6	 The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .	1

2831	c671d1df3ec7d6642f5cc93d9	 The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .	1
2832	44b3c0586e93a2e094f9efec0	 Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .	1
2833	e8df712a8db394e7f790136ea	 It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .	1

2846	32847b40f2dd23c429c41e83f	 Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .	1
2847	89decfe430479dd9586b36d3b	 Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken	1

2849	cda036622bdcf0079a7b4faf2	 A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .	1
2850	9ad6d708424cdf71b1a4dbc22	 Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '	1
2851	92e2840769998994a8a8a0b5e	 But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .	1

2858	8b69a57457b10b7795ab37e66	 It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .	1
2859	e7734b9ebe6454667a88257c4	 We just do n't really care too much about this love story .	1
2860	3d22628198a591e92def4abdf	 The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .	1
2861	d347ec2a0826db94e05d82c08	 Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...	1
2862	483830f9c7aeeebedb9f3db26	 Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .	3
2863	163895e9d045109e3a4b4478f	 But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .	1

2865	a94d89190f992ba69702ed318	 A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .	1
2866	7c1e30a25cf667f9584a360c7	 Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .	3
2867	7ad5dbd3e305b2a4418553473	 A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .	1
2868	e941b9af091352307eedaef3a	 An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .	1
2869	fa819ce6a928b21c33e26ce60	 Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .	3
2870	a5bb087daccfaeffb0ffa4c1d	 An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .	1
2871	df0809f83e33f0144e4320c45	 As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -LRB- Franco -RRB- has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .	1
2872	3bbbba3818f6bd77adc7602e9	 ` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .	1
2873	6fe6c33ed74df8ee4c805a3fa	 It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .	1
2874	90a9a1be40bb0517cf705d165	 Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .	1
2875	31f03d3fc00200e49c73a42d0	 Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .	1
2876	1c61e9dc17d10ca9af46b2001	 The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .	1
2877	318f189f96da6f1bb5529bad9	 ... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .	1
2878	e2b8f6613140bdadde4779c5d	 Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .	1
2879	846f1a9f82d7f59718b7443a1	 It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .	1
2880	7ad6065adbce6951273a90c02	 This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .	1
2881	e28717f533030235389457aab	 Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .	1
2882	cee17df24a98e8a6734e97193	 The Château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .	1
2883	d1d1c0e1a3ea4fba97112a488	 Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .	1
2884	2b964284bb7851b21c0dbd569	 It 's better than The Phantom Menace .	3
2885	a63e0dde5289bacfcf4c56ad8	 But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .	1
2886	75ecf56ee1a9c053633595088	 A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .	1
2887	2b9423d4ed53348962e0b6541	 Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .	1
2888	1ea246b76d33e22ba0505aa33	 Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .	1
2889	a06ae951b01001b2e2e26670b	 Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .	1
2890	462cda62830a248f6c2ce6c8e	 A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .	1
2891	586a7ea2908323f2af19e4063	 Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .	1
2892	8e8280f198cf9042cefe85542	 A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .	1
2893	15905e3c3e550bd64397d5df5	 The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -LRB- it -RRB- comes off like a Hallmark commercial .	1
2894	02d1c7cc22e81fe5bbd90f36d	 What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .	1
2895	e3b68b44e6cf14d9776d35996	 The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .	1
2896	f28e97124d04737fa7357860d	 ... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...	1
2897	eb83a3f908da50d3a69940334	 The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .	1
2898	7b3703dbde2ae6dc2a2e04bf6	 Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .	1
2899	3dffd8ec37c00939b8b70ebf2	 This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .	1
2900	e7f9b59ef812ec383b8f362be	 But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .	1
2901	fe175bb5c741eb0e312836fd5	 Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .	3
2902	06f3b04d18e57f3b6cbb68628	 A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .	1
2903	59db1a626424acb2488146fc6	 It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .	1
2904	ea79cd059f2334a60a4bfa1a1	 The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .	1
2905	e2761e2f6c4a88d7c4294da17	 An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .	1
2906	38f3f0f01049d6364e78eac56	 Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .	1
2907	04feb1434e2777959774e01b6	 Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .	1
2908	379b712abb4ad3e061ef0062e	 Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .	1
2909	d4c029d4c23a1b67be493fd90	 Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .	1
2910	058a817dd3162e6fd4ec6c0d1	 Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .	1
2911	75b2cbbd9d00815b6777599fe	 The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .	1
2912	67661e6ff89333f8d9952321a	 With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .	1
2913	36e3c156e1914cad377af3b3f	 It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .	1
2914	9c89efcf53a7af41b7ab2e3f8	 Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?	1

4072	79b32e03d583b6deedc2705a1	 Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '	1
4073	76b7b36a5ca64832395eb25b5	 A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .	1
4074	703302b9f3a93f6f9315fb813	 The movie is without intent .	1
4075	330108835d623eaf1b089ec38	 While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .	1
4076	540f6baab59d7b34dd0b8c911	 If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is -LRB- Cattaneo -RRB- sophomore slump .	1
4077	924a486c667e909129f451013	 Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .	1
4078	ba1c5853276b6e3ba025b53c6	 Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .	1
4079	14ab0acd58dbb45aeab80e8ea	 The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?	1
4080	7a2a99d886318d6997e048d8e	 The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .	1
4081	701fd4e50672d574461ed6055	 Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .	1
4082	ecd956cb6f73926bf3a86d5ac	 It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .	1

4087	7f32048ca972d44c4a8c31784	 The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .	1
4088	3882195528532c23d5fdc3abb	 The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .	3

4092	a992a2c2b842e2beec0ae4ebc	 A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .	1
4093	910c600728edbfab3e28fa725	 If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .	3
4094	02d2ecc11e228ae91cc6ecc82	 The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .	1
4095	762fa7970745ff404e6997f71	 Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .	1
4096	f9bb45f4143fdb3d47922cd5b	 Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !	3
4097	f660f85cc97cf5011e48d27c0	 While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .	1
4098	926c61e9e3190fb84bf619faa	 Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .	1
4099	060765a6fbf1c2567da978b74	 For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .	1
4100	a4bd377526803d29ad3924f65	 Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .	1

4102	741617a402a078d65a449ad4e	 Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .	3

4104	cb840b8250f12086c4f77cd9d	 Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?	1
4105	802cd6062956161a0373b8e58	 Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	1
4106	8c748b0460ed47ef29154fd1d	 Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .	3
4107	30513343d0b2bd8c25a0c64bc	 I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .	1

4111	58fa7b840c27edd3c66fd7099	 Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .	1
4112	376f8c4c7b2858c0dcbf96ddd	 It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .	1
4113	dbfab5f6f234214f1a18f105a	 The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .	1

4118	925f535ab3930dcfe5b05ff37	 Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .	1

4131	79290d6ea68eda2de02ee7994	 Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .	1
4132	bc2c5e546bc5eddcc1411e743	 The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .	1
4133	2a18701c1c5089d6848d5a88f	 But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .	1
4134	47cd50f2418928c75de42810f	 Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .	1

4142	7fc1cfa62fc4ef2b0443af1c7	 What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .	3
4143	22f089e10b7aeb879c8c00c73	 An ugly , revolting movie .	1
4144	4f9863522614e15de2595a21b	 The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .	1
4145	f54327dffe618b5ec66d1fcea	 Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .	1

4147	581fabb5c0451a649cbde5266	 My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .	1
4148	d6305c1422d50b45068fcae9c	 Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .	1
4149	a903c99a6387a60b7f9da1ab5	 An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .	1
4150	f0e5219e0fd96189c72aac03a	 Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .	1
4151	018f09ebdba29af26af2f3109	 Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .	1
4152	5b602fee129a4da28f90ce0ab	 Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .	1
4153	d5790929afbe72e48f74c71a3	 Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .	1
4154	dfc042dffddefc5e17ecb35d1	 Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .	1

4159	0eb46c1ff9e038d2d56d21608	 Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .	1
4160	01b90cac918e023b6762a3282	 While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter	1
4161	6106c71495fb6f786f6477721	 Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .	1
4162	5e1a87ecf48beb809735f4d84	 The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .	1
4163	a41725e002c8264e871df71a8	 The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .	1
4164	a78ccca508a85cc3fa9c41666	 It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .	1

4168	74ff0b1ca9606377673ec3699	 Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .	1

4170	f7728366df96ca970ef67b8c9	 Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .	1

4172	dd7af450d0a4e8a26f766567a	 The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .	1
4173	f64923da97dae96413815b29a	 The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .	1

4189	0444cec0161848f1b9c36f730	 Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .	1
4190	70ea14ec93ea7326557ed816f	 Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .	1
4191	4783aab92fbdf6336bdcc4ad5	 If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.	1

4202	14cbaaede7ba8622e2b27798d	 Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .	1

4208	a6f0f02f0d8983ab47cf9a6cc	 Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .	1

4221	0ac77762541f86c72eeffac6d	 Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .	1
4222	7e5bc3fcff5e7c4a0bdb30c2c	 Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?	1
4223	6c147740475d5b92fefd59fef	 Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .	1
4224	f98bb388d4dab39372130a947	 Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .	1
4225	930b494c00e62c263846e4ef4	 If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .	1
4226	cafd63cdda61874206cd09aa3	 A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .	1
4227	86952077249c28a34ee51064e	 A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .	1
4228	392a98668e6668cb1c7d38604	 Where the film falters is in its tone .	1
4229	991b86f39cb5eb90c185d9271	 The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	1
4230	d6486b6c9dd98e8d6c2db199d	 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	1
4231	8eabd8b0c339f86322d32c66a	 Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .	3
4232	bf1174be7f58e164cc1324a30	 Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .	1
4233	20be2fe9e8785082eb9451c4c	 Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .	1
4234	6c6106adfc3092f7d095e84d7	 The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .	1
4235	3325332c2fb1ab16a0f8e8483	 Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !	1
4236	79bbb97c5e3450959036a2e15	 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .	3
4237	64deedd5ec803c9e8754b4a25	 It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	1
4238	87ba102f6d05fb25b4f950672	 This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	1
4239	aca3f8df5c1999aa59972e2e2	 The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .	1
4240	a08707a13cc2760f06137b88c	 Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .	1
4241	57118f07d4d6e03474e67ac92	 It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .	1
4242	47656095cdaad3adc2ecb8a5e	 ... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .	1
4243	1acffb07ed3656609256c6457	 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .	1
4244	e35a3619b8a63004c197aa19c	 Competently directed but terminally cute drama .	3
4245	e6319be6cbf872e27e599835b	 The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	1
4246	81c5e548c7593d7019bc8f0d6	 Not just unlikable .	1
4247	b02c227d0916aec00177ceb36	 Disturbing .	1
4248	fa96f70df594dd7d0fc266ca6	 Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .	3
4249	8c6edc7ac053ff56276acbc35	 The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .	1
4250	b8c7b1d66ad4d2a9fa8ff3301	 The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .	3
4251	b06a18419dbfa739c58f38587	 The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .	1
4252	e3d71220329572e4400f5e35d	 The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .	1
4253	4a537eabc9ebb20a540f1fd31	 Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .	1
4254	b56ab17a85d1a14742d19e7f9	 An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .	1
4255	96308cad8a7e7108403467108	 A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .	3
4256	5ac55c428ad7dbfd27634dd3f	 This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .	1
4257	890f5e0b5ec00df0d97429cb7	 This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .	1
4258	ba29a8724348a2718d22121e2	 The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .	1
4259	ce59c02c8cabcd2d28f8425e5	 Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .	1
4260	5e5ad8ff9fc85ce0e54e85f8e	 A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .	1
4261	c7aa89daedbf79dca0cdab983	 Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	1
4262	6948c5f28ceb70ac9808b98e6	 The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .	1
4263	59b92845ca06f3559f13f82f9	 The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .	3
4264	78e877aca63c918558939c28c	 The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .	1
4265	185c403fb2afd8a05b72a61db	 Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .	1
4266	96c0e9f28cdcd75df97bd1530	 The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?	3
4267	f122c9d616f797c1f262af262	 The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .	1
4268	887cf6e4a20c173a789c3499f	 ... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	1
4269	3ae756d2bfc12cb724e165711	 A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .	1
4270	df15ae069395caa4d73e4335f	 Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .	1
4271	6724daccc17e3e05cecdad9bd	 This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	1
4272	cb6d6d7a5c33216b3a8a7ae8b	 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue	1
4273	38a2e92065fad700a3cf5f4a9	 The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '	1
4274	122ad782776d1307305eba405	 Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?	1
4275	9f02027e3f8387d57f22ef8f1	 More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine	1

4277	80062071983a18d129c0450c8	 The drama discloses almost nothing .	1
4278	8490925d218c093a4afba3ac5	 A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .	1
4279	9707c35ef0aa2d381181bcab4	 Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .	1
4280	22a9d6861ac4f6158381655a1	 As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .	1
4281	10df1c57c70fa050096c04034	 Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	1
4282	0af41006d2dab8a22eeb4da04	 -LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .	1
4283	03c651e5431137ed75b66db9f	 One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .	1
4284	870f5c92c2e1a95baaf602c38	 Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .	1

4287	b688089fbb810c969809a3b8e	 ... a rather bland affair .	1
4288	1f3fc60effcd3461db9b70693	 A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .	1
4289	bcc7392c35ad92d8da010619d	 The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .	1
4290	9893892280bdaf237291d9c23	 Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .	1
4291	1a45a19033a6f00274a30eb38	 Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .	3
4292	15eb7422a4dc9895eb7eeda1c	 It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .	1
4293	b351f1180979a308272e32988	 I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .	1

4304	4f99167fd4a88ae2656c371ff	 I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits	1
4305	f2931a693eccef803d4612d93	 Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .	1

4309	3e41584e3500a3ebfa64fedef	 An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .	1
4310	dc61c2e0ce9c17b16f841799f	 One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .	1
4311	ff111b4acb5f479d9c9f10f04	 A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .	1
4312	c56e6538e58bf564169e0531e	 Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .	1

4347	ba0e27beccba5532c245c1f45	 The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .	1
4348	ade2488bf0bac8f21baee56bb	 This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .	1
