2	 No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .

2	 You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .
0	 ... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
0	 Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .

0	 This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
2	 It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
0	 The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
2	 It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
2	 Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
2	 Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .

0	 A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
0	 The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .

2	 An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .

0	 It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
0	 MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .

2	 A drama ?
2	 A romance ?
2	 Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .
2	 Did the film inform and educate me ?
2	 Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?
0	 Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
0	 Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
2	 A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
0	 This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
2	 Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .
0	 In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
0	 It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .

0	 A chiller resolutely without chills .
0	 `` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
2	 The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight .
0	 Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
2	 Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clich√©s that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .

4	 Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
2	 As social expos√© , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on .
0	 The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
2	 There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
0	 The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
2	 This one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived .
0	 Bad and baffling from the get-go .

0	 Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
0	 Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
0	 Horrible .
0	 The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
0	 Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .

0	 With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .

0	 Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
0	 The comedy is nonexistent .

0	 The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
2	 One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .
2	 Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .
2	 ... will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks .
0	 After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .

0	 A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
2	 It 's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by Elizabeth Hurley in a bathing suit .
2	 ... one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .
2	 Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
0	 Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .
0	 The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
0	 A clich√©d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men .
2	 Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .
2	 In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
2	 You end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .
2	 Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .

2	 Gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it .

2	 Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority .
2	 It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
2	 The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
0	 What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .

2	 Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
0	 Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
0	 Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
2	 Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
0	 It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
0	 A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
0	 The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na√Øvet√© and arbitrary flashbacks .
2	 Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
0	 ... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .

0	 I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
0	 Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
0	 One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
0	 True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
0	 The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
2	 You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .

0	 I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
2	 This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '
2	 than ` Magnifique ' .
0	 Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
0	 But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
2	 Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .
2	 Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0	 is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
2	 Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
0	 Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
2	 Who is this movie for ?
2	 Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .
0	 It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '

2	 The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
4	 But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
2	 Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .

2	 The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects .
0	 The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
0	 What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
0	 The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
0	 Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .

0	 -LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
0	 The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
2	 This Scarlet 's letter is A. . .
2	 The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .
2	 A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .

2	 She 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ...
2	 Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
2	 Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .

0	 Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
2	 Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .
2	 There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings .
2	 Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition .

2	 Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
0	 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
2	 Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
0	 Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
0	 A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .
0	 The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
0	 Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
0	 It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m√©tier .
2	 How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .

0	 Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
2	 Amid the clich√© and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn .

0	 There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
0	 I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .

2	 Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .

0	 Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
2	 Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
2	 One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
0	 Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
4	 It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
0	 What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
0	 The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
0	 Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
0	 No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
0	 Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
2	 A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
0	 Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
0	 For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
0	 A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
0	 It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .

2	 It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
2	 For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .
2	 It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .
2	 But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
2	 If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .
0	 It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
2	 It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
0	 A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '
0	 This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .
2	 The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
0	 It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
0	 This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
0	 Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
0	 Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
0	 No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
2	 ` Hey Arnold ! '
2	 has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
2	 They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .
0	 A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .
0	 Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
2	 It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
2	 A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
2	 Falls short in explaining the music and its roots .
0	 What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
2	 They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
0	 It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
2	 It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
2	 Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
0	 Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
2	 Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences .
0	 One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .
2	 There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .
0	 What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
2	 Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .
0	 Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
0	 The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
0	 It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
0	 It 's that painful .
2	 God is great , the movie 's not .
2	 When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
2	 Or else a doggie winks .
0	 A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
0	 You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
0	 A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .
2	 -LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
0	 Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
2	 Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
0	 After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich√© has been unturned .
0	 Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
2	 It was a dark and stormy night ...
2	 This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang 's forte and it shows .
0	 Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
2	 Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .
0	 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
2	 Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
2	 Even with Harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .
0	 The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
2	 Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0	 Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
0	 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters
2	 Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role .
0	 High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
0	 A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
2	 Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .
0	 It recycles every clich√© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
2	 I 'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .
2	 Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .
0	 It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .

2	 Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .
0	 All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .
2	 The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
0	 ... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
0	 The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .
2	 No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
0	 Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
0	 Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
0	 The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '

0	 It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
0	 It 's just merely very bad .
2	 About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men .
0	 In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .

2	 Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
2	 A road trip that will get you thinking , ` Are we there yet ? '
0	 If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
0	 This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
0	 It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
2	 And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .
2	 Dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .

0	 Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .
2	 It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
0	 A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
2	 The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .
0	 A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
2	 The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .

0	 A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
2	 Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
0	 If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
0	 A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
0	 Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
2	 If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .
2	 Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
0	 Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
2	 It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .

2	 The camera whirls !
2	 The camera twirls !
2	 Wow , a jump cut !

4	 Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
0	 A ragbag of cliches .
2	 This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .

0	 What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?
2	 Collateral Damage offers formula payback and the Big Payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .
0	 The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a souffl√© gone wrong .
0	 Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
2	 You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?
0	 We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
2	 The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .

0	 -LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
0	 The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
2	 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .

2	 Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .
2	 A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
0	 Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
0	 Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
2	 How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- Fran√ßois and Mich√®le 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .

2	 An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .
0	 Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
0	 This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
2	 I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
0	 What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
0	 Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .

0	 director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention
2	 Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
0	 I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
2	 While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .

0	 There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
0	 Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .

2	 The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .
0	 The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
0	 This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
2	 It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
0	 The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .

0	 I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
0	 Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
2	 A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .

0	 The film is all over the place , really .
2	 The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
0	 Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
0	 Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
0	 Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
0	 It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
0	 And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
2	 The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
0	 Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
0	 The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
2	 Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
0	 Press the delete key .
2	 ... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
0	 There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
2	 Or for the year , for that matter .
0	 Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
0	 This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
0	 The threat implied in the title Pok√©mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
0	 To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
2	 Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .
2	 Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .
2	 And a very rainy day .
2	 Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?
2	 Um , no. .
2	 Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
2	 But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
2	 Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
2	 Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
0	 But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
0	 Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
0	 It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
0	 It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
2	 Routine and rather silly .
0	 A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
0	 Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
0	 You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
2	 While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
0	 Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
0	 If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
2	 A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
0	 The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
0	 The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
0	 Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
0	 Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
0	 The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
2	 As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' .
2	 A well-acted , but one-note film .
0	 -LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
0	 There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
0	 No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
2	 The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
0	 We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
0	 Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
0	 When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
0	 Marinated in clich√©s and mawkish dialogue .
0	 But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
0	 Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
0	 We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
2	 Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
0	 With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
2	 When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
2	 When the violence actually shocked ?
2	 When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
0	 This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
0	 What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
0	 In other words , it 's badder than bad .
2	 It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
0	 Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
2	 Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
0	 Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
2	 An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
0	 A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
2	 A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
0	 It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
0	 It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich√©s the filmmakers could dredge up .
2	 in period costume and with a bigger budget .
0	 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
2	 A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
0	 A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
0	 If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clich√© .
0	 Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
2	 Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
0	 ` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
2	 Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
2	 Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .
0	 Hate it because it 's lousy .
0	 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
0	 Disgusting .
0	 Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
0	 This thing is virtually unwatchable .
0	 Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
0	 The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
0	 In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
0	 Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
0	 The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
2	 A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
2	 Spy-vs .
0	 - spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
0	 A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
2	 The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
0	 Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
2	 Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .
2	 A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
2	 Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
2	 An extraordinarily silly thriller .
0	 Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
0	 What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
0	 No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
0	 The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
2	 This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Am√©lie .
2	 Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
2	 If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
2	 Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
0	 Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
0	 Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
0	 Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
0	 A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
0	 A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
2	 There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
2	 And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
2	 It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
2	 It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
4	 The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
2	 But it does n't need Gangs of New York .
2	 Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
2	 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
2	 It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
0	 Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
0	 Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
0	 It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
2	 Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
2	 The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
2	 I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .
2	 Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
0	 Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
0	 All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
0	 If you go , pack your knitting needles .
0	 The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
0	 Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
0	 It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
0	 A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
0	 The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
0	 Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
2	 Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
0	 Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
0	 Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
2	 an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
0	 An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
0	 ... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
0	 The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
2	 A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
2	 Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
0	 -LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
2	 ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
0	 Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
0	 You have no affinity for most of the characters .
2	 A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
0	 An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
2	 Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .
2	 Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
0	 You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
2	 In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
2	 Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
2	 Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .
0	 Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
0	 How about surprising us by trying something new ?
0	 Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
2	 If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
0	 Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
0	 You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
2	 The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
2	 This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
0	 A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
2	 Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
2	 One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .
0	 Too bad none of it is funny .
2	 The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
2	 The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
0	 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
2	 Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
2	 Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
2	 While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
2	 It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
2	 The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
0	 You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
2	 If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .
2	 Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
0	 A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
0	 Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
2	 Hey Arnold !
2	 is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .
0	 Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
0	 The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
2	 The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
0	 ... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
2	 In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
0	 Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
2	 You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
0	 Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
2	 the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
0	 If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
0	 It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
0	 Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0	 As pedestrian as they come .
0	 It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
2	 Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
0	 Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
0	 The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
0	 A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
2	 Muddled , trashy and incompetent
2	 Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
0	 It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
0	 A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
0	 There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
2	 The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
4	 One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
4	 It 's a masterpiece .
2	 It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
2	 Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
4	 Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
2	 A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
4	 Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
2	 Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
4	 It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
4	 A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
4	 One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
2	 The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
4	 Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
0	 Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
2	 Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
2	 I survived .
0	 The worst film of the year .
0	 ... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
0	 I ca n't recommend it .
2	 The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?
2	 There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
2	 Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
0	 It sucked .
2	 Would I see it again ?
2	 Please see previous answer .
2	 It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
2	 `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat .
2	 The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
0	 What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
2	 Please .
0	 Does n't add up to much .
