0	 I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
0	 Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .

0	 This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
0	 Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
0	 Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .

0	 An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .

0	 The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
0	 Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
0	 If you 're over 25 , have an IQ over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
0	 The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
0	 Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level .
0	 And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
0	 Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
0	 The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
0	 Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
0	 But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
0	 The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
0	 It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
0	 Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
0	 A thriller without a lot of thrills .
0	 Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands .
0	 A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
0	 Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
0	 The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon\/Bourne or his predicament .
0	 I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
0	 Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
0	 The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
0	 Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''
0	 Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .
0	 It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
0	 It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
0	 The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
0	 Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
0	 ... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
0	 Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
0	 Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .
0	 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
0	 In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
0	 After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
0	 The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
0	 Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .
0	 The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
0	 Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
0	 Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
0	 Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
0	 What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
0	 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
0	 There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
0	 An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
0	 The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
0	 Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
0	 Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
0	 Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
0	 A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
0	 Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
0	 It would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde 's classic satire .
0	 Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
0	 The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
0	 Just plain bad .
0	 You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
0	 An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
0	 Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .
0	 Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
0	 What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .
0	 Director Douglas McGrath takes on Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .
0	 Lazy , miserable and smug .
0	 It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
0	 ... hypnotically dull .
0	 ... irritating soul-searching garbage .
0	 It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
0	 `` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
0	 Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
0	 Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .
0	 What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
0	 This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
0	 One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
0	 One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
0	 ... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
0	 Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
0	 The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
0	 The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
0	 When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
0	 Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
0	 The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .
0	 Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
0	 ... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
0	 A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
0	 A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .
0	 The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .
0	 Sluggish , tonally uneven .
0	 If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .
0	 Imagine -LRB- if possible -RRB- a Pasolini film without passion or politics , or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching O Fantasma .
0	 The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
0	 About the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time .
0	 Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
0	 By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
0	 Cinematic poo .
0	 The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
0	 The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
0	 Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
0	 Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
0	 A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
0	 The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .
0	 `` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time .
0	 Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .
0	 I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
0	 Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
0	 Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum .
0	 Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
0	 At times , it actually hurts to watch .
0	 But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
0	 If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
0	 One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
0	 It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
0	 This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
0	 A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
0	 Many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and I do n't think that A.C. will help this movie one bit .
0	 It 's Pauly Shore awful .
0	 In other words , it 's badder than bad .
0	 ... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
0	 Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
0	 A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
0	 Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
0	 ... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
0	 It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
0	 It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
0	 Utter mush ... conceited pap .
0	 It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
0	 -LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
0	 The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
0	 The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
0	 Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
0	 Should have gone straight to video .
0	 The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
0	 Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
0	 Horrible .
0	 Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
0	 Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
0	 Terrible .
0	 If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
0	 Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
0	 Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
0	 The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
0	 Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
0	 Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
0	 My own minority report is that it stinks .
0	 A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
0	 The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
0	 The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- achievement does n't match his ambition .
0	 ... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
0	 This thing is virtually unwatchable .
0	 Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
0	 A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
0	 As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
0	 -LRB- A -RRB- poorly executed comedy .
0	 This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
0	 Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .
0	 Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
0	 Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
0	 We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
0	 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
0	 This thing is just garbage .
0	 There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
0	 The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
0	 A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
0	 Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
0	 It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
0	 One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
0	 Black-and-white and unrealistic .
0	 This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
0	 A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
0	 Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
0	 Where 's the movie here ?
0	 Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
0	 We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
0	 This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
0	 Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
0	 Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
0	 This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
0	 Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
0	 ... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... The film 's ending has a `` What was it all for ? ''
0	 Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
0	 Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
0	 Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
0	 Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
0	 The film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
0	 An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
0	 Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
0	 The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
0	 A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
0	 The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
0	 Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
0	 Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
0	 An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
0	 Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .
0	 A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
0	 With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
0	 Stay away .
0	 The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
0	 Thumbs down .
0	 Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
0	 The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
0	 ` The Château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
0	 Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .
0	 Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
0	 Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
0	 Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
0	 It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
0	 The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
0	 The film is all over the place , really .
0	 I 'd rather watch a rerun of The Powerpuff Girls
0	 For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .
0	 Poor Ben Bratt could n't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .
0	 Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .
0	 Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
0	 Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
0	 under-rehearsed and lifeless
0	 One of the most incoherent features in recent memory .
0	 This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
0	 We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
0	 Hate it because it 's lousy .
0	 Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
0	 A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
0	 The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .
0	 Oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .
0	 You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
0	 If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
0	 Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
0	 In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
0	 It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .
0	 It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
0	 ... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
0	 It 's Splash without the jokes .
0	 Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
0	 The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .
0	 The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
0	 Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
0	 Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
0	 Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
0	 ... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
0	 A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
0	 None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
0	 ... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
0	 Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
0	 It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
0	 All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .
0	 A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .
0	 The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
0	 It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
0	 Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .
0	 Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
0	 ` It 's painful to watch Witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination , I mean , Alabama . '
0	 Despite bearing the Paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement European pickup .
0	 A sentimental mess that never rings true .
0	 Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
0	 Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
0	 Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
0	 Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
0	 Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .
0	 This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
0	 This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
0	 After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned .
0	 Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
0	 Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .
0	 In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
0	 A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
0	 A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
0	 A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
0	 It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
0	 `` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
0	 If you 're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , I have just one word for you - -- Decasia
0	 Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
0	 Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
0	 Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
0	 I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .
0	 A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
0	 It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
0	 The thing just never gets off the ground .
0	 The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
0	 Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
0	 An empty , purposeless exercise .
0	 There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
0	 The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
0	 Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
0	 An infuriating film .
0	 The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
0	 But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
0	 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
0	 Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .
0	 Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
0	 Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
0	 The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
0	 Pompous and garbled .
0	 As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
0	 The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
0	 The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
0	 The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .
0	 No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .
0	 The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -LRB- unintentionally -RRB- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .
0	 Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
0	 It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .
0	 Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
0	 In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
0	 The Paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -LRB- restored -RRB- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .

1	 If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .

1	 Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This , not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro 's right-hand goombah .
1	 -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .

2	 Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
2	 It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .
2	 the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .

2	 Ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what - time-it-is tedious .
2	 The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .
2	 Almost .
2	 The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
2	 When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
2	 The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .
2	 Whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .
2	 Some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .

2	 The question hanging over The Time Machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '
2	 Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .
2	 An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .

2	 For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ?
2	 It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .

2	 `` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .
2	 Amid the cliché and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn .
2	 A picture as erratic as its central character .
2	 The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect .
2	 It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
2	 At its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .
2	 I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .
2	 If you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .
2	 Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .
2	 Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies .
2	 It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
2	 Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
2	 The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?
2	 And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser .
2	 Your taste for Jonah - A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit .
2	 A fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories .
2	 This version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .
2	 Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
2	 Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs .
2	 `` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .
2	 It 's a sight to behold .
2	 The film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .
2	 It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
2	 If the movie were all comedy , it might work better .
2	 And a very rainy day .
2	 I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
2	 The path Ice Age follows most closely , though , is the one established by Warner Bros. giant Chuck Jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release .
2	 Merci pour le movie .
2	 Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle .
2	 The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .
2	 A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .
2	 The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING .
2	 Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .
2	 The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
2	 Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .
2	 With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact , Harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
2	 New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...
2	 I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story .
2	 Cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of Those Days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie .
2	 Too ordinary to restore -LRB- Harmon -RRB- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .
2	 Occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .
2	 Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
2	 Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .
2	 Please .
2	 Dogtown and Z-Boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become `` the punk kids ' revolution . ''
2	 It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .
2	 Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
2	 One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .
2	 It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .
2	 A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
2	 If you do n't ... well , skip to another review .
2	 Lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
2	 A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .
2	 Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .
2	 Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
2	 Well , they 're ` they ' .
2	 The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
2	 This new Time Machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable .
2	 Wanker Goths are on the loose !
2	 Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
2	 `` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
2	 And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
2	 This is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .
2	 Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
2	 The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
2	 Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .
2	 A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .
2	 Entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from Venus and men from Mars can indeed get together .
2	 An unflinching look at the world 's dispossessed .
2	 Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
2	 An extraordinarily silly thriller .
2	 You bet there is and it 's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking .
2	 Consider this review life-affirming .
2	 has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
2	 If you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .
2	 There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious .
2	 It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .
2	 Leading a double life in an American film only comes to no good , but not here .
2	 Witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it 's Dench who really steals the show .
2	 Saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .
2	 A virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze .
2	 If you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you 'll see Del Toro has brought unexpected gravity to Blade II .
2	 An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
2	 ... the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation .
2	 Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .
2	 ... manages to fall closer in quality to Silence than to the abysmal Hannibal .
2	 For all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , Blood Work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
2	 It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
2	 Feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work .
2	 Cube 's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche .
2	 Lan Yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that Happy Together shoots for -LRB- and misses -RRB- .
2	 Hey Arnold !
2	 Dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch .
2	 Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .
2	 The movie is our story as much as it is Schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .
2	 The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List .
2	 Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
2	 Granddad of Le Nouvelle Vague , Jean-Luc Godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .
2	 A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
2	 What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .
2	 It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
2	 It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .
2	 A poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
2	 Sometimes shorter is better .
2	 Not bad , but not all that good .
2	 The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .
2	 With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .
2	 What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .
2	 A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .
2	 Was I scared ?
2	 Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
2	 It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .
2	 If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
2	 Tsai Ming-liang 's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being .
2	 Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .
2	 With this new Rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
2	 I 'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes .
2	 ... a lesson in prehistoric hilarity .
2	 A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
2	 Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .
2	 Red Dragon is less baroque and showy than Hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than Silence .
2	 There 's not much to Fatale , outside of its stylish surprises ... but that 's OK .
2	 What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?
2	 Would I see it again ?
2	 A perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film .
2	 The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
2	 Were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about Cal than does the movie or the character any good , Freundlich 's World Traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year .
2	 Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' .
2	 Greengrass -LRB- working from Don Mullan 's script -RRB- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .
2	 -LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spider-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .
2	 A well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .
2	 A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
2	 -LRB- Garbus -RRB- discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
2	 Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .
2	 Cinematic pratfalls given a working over .
2	 Matches neorealism 's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives .
2	 The Grey Zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of Holocaust movies ... but the film suffers from its own difficulties .
2	 ` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .
2	 This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .
2	 This movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .
2	 The camera twirls !
2	 In the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , Like Mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency .
2	 The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .
2	 It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
2	 Going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it 's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it 's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through .
2	 So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
2	 This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .
2	 ` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
2	 You want to call Domino 's .
2	 Provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all .
2	 Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
2	 At no point during K-19 : The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .
2	 Really dumb but occasionally really funny .
2	 The faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of V.S. Naipaul 's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour .
2	 I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
2	 The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .
2	 It 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear .
2	 Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
2	 This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .
2	 Overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .
2	 So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .
2	 It never is , not fully .
2	 Largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .
2	 Same guy with both hats .
2	 There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .
2	 Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .
2	 A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .
2	 It would be disingenuous to call Reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex .
2	 `` 13 Conversations '' holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point .
2	 The same should go for movie theaters .
2	 The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
2	 The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
2	 You 'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you 'll laugh .
2	 But something seems to be missing .
2	 It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
2	 Just a Kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people .
2	 Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .
2	 Not the best Herzog perhaps , but unmistakably Herzog .
2	 ... salaciously simplistic .
2	 Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
2	 So unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is .
2	 There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .
